# [ ] User Account - This is all basic concept. Know who your administrators are and who aren't supposed to have that kind of privilege. Remove users that are not supposed to be allowed access to your system. Such as a guest account or a backdoor created user.
#
# [ ] Group Settings -  Same as above. Know who should be in the sudoers group or a administrator.
#
# [ ] Firewall - Enable a firewall such as UFW or IPTABLES to help prevent unwanted connections to the system.
#
# [ ] Group Permissions - Label what a group should and should not be capable of doing. Such as having access to SSH or SMB.
#
# [ ] Audit Policies - Policies that allow users to be able to change information on the system.
#
# [ ] Password Policies - Strength requirements such as a minimum and maximum age and warn date. As well as some PAM complexity guidelines.
#
# [ ] Antivirus -  Tools to prevent viruses or potentially unwanted software to be found on your system.
#
# [ ] Account Lockout Policies - Failed attempt lockout. 
#
# [ ] Remote Access and Backdoors -  Processes such as ssh, telnet, or netcat that allow more that one entry point in the system.
#
# [ ] Security Settings - Settings such as what should be allowed to be used on a system such as an example autoplay on windows. 
#
# [ ] Services - Programs that are running as services on the computer that are opening ports and making changes on the system.
#
# [ ] Shared Folders - On a professional device nobody should be able to see each other's files unless an exception has been made.
#
# [ ] Updates - Updates for a system to be at the most latest and secure version. 
# 
# [ ] Connections - Look for unwanted connections that are unwanted on your system such as telnet. 
#
# [ ] Networking - A good system would prevent TCP/IP spoofing and sniffing on their system.
